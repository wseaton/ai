//! Incremental Chat Completions SSE to Responses SSE conversion.
//!
//! [`StreamConverter`] is a pure, request-scoped state machine. It consumes
//! Chat Completions streaming chunks, emits the corresponding Responses
//! streaming events with a monotonic `sequence_number`, and builds the terminal
//! resource by reusing the finite translation builders so the streamed terminal
//! matches the non-streaming translation exactly.
//!
//! The converter never buffers a full response: each [`push`](StreamConverter::push)
//! returns only the bytes for events completed by that chunk. Framing is
//! isolated in the `framing` module so a future shared SSE codec can replace
//! it without touching this state machine.
