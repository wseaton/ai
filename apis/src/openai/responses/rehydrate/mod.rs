//! ## Response-side `previous_response_id` restore
//!
//! When history is rehydrated, the proxy strips `previous_response_id`
//! from the upstream request (prior turns are replayed via the `input`
//! array), so the backend echoes `null`. The Responses API contract
//! always echoes the caller's `previous_response_id`, so the response
//! phase restores it on the way out:
//!
//! - **Non-streaming** (`application/json`): the finite body is buffered and the ID rewritten in one shot
//!   ([`restore_previous_response_id`]).
//! - **Streaming** (`text/event-stream`): frames pass through byte-for-byte; only a response-lifecycle frame's `data:`
//!   JSON payload is rewritten in place, and only that. No frame is reconstructed, so `id:`, `retry:`, comments, and
//!   unknown SSE fields survive untouched. At most one partial frame is ever buffered — never the whole stream
//!   ([`restore_previous_response_id_stream_chunk`]).
//!
//! Both paths fail open: any parse error passes the bytes through
//! untouched and never errors the request.
